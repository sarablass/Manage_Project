# MilestoneTaskManager: Advanced Task Management System

MilestoneTaskManager is a comprehensive task management system designed to help project managers and engineers organize, assign, and track tasks effectively within a project. Built with a focus on multi-tier architecture, it ensures modularity, scalability, and efficient data processing. The system is developed using C# 7 and .NET 11, providing a seamless and responsive user experience through its modern GUI.

## Key Features

- **Task Management**: Easily create, update, assign, and track tasks throughout various project stages, ensuring smooth project flow and timely completion.
